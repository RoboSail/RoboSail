How to use Electronic Compass for RoboSail boats
using Adafruit LSM303 3-axis magnetometer and 3-axis accelerometer
 1 basic operation to verify hardware and connections (compassBasic)
 2 hard-iron calibration program to get values for other programs (compassCalibration)
 3 basic operation with hard-iron calibration (compassBasicwithCalibration)
 4 basic operation with hard-iron calibration and Orientation library (compassTest)
 5 tilt-compensated operation (compassBasicwithCalibrationandTilt)

In the "Libraries/Orientation" folder:

Orientation.cpp - Library for tilt calibrated compass readings
Orientation.h - Header file for library


In the "hardware/compass" folder:

compassBasic - Raw accelerometer and magnetometer readings and prints to the screen
compassCalibration - Code to use to determine hard iron calibration
compassBasicwithCalibration - hard iron and axis orientation correction (same as CompassTest with hardiron correction)
compassTest - Example of how to use Orientation library (get values from compassCalibration first)
compassBasicwithCalibrationandTilt - roll, pitch, yaw, and heading


The roll, pitch, yaw, and headings all use the standard (Aircraft)
orientations:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes

A positive roll angle lifts the left wing and lowers the right wing.
A positive pitch angle raises the nose and lowers the tail.
A positive yaw, or heading angle, moves the nose to the right.

A yaw of 0 degrees is pointing towards Magnetic North.

Heading ranges from 0 to 360 degrees.
A heading of 0 degrees is pointing towards True North.
A heading of 90 degrees is pointing East, 180 is South, 270 is West.

For RoboSail we change to a different fram of reference where East is 0 deg,
North is 90 deg, West ia 180 deg, and South is 270 deg. To get this do 
RoboSailHeading = (360 - heading) + 90
We also use roll to find the heel of the boat.  
We define positive roll as leaning to Port and negative roll as leaning to Starboard.
To get this simply negate roll.  RoboSailRoll = -1 * roll

Because of the way the calculations are done, the heading will not be
accurate if the pitch approaches 90 or -90, but that shouldn't be a
problem (unless the boat is sinking it shouldn't be pointing straight up
or down). Otherwise, I think the heading should be accurate, even if the
boat is healing up to 75 degrees or so in either direction.
