/* WindSensor rev 7/21/2015
Â© 2014-2015 RoboSail
This program reads and displays data from the wind sensor, a continuous rotary 
magnetic encoder with a 10 bit PWM output. (US Digital MA3-P10-25B)
It is used to verify that the sensor is connected and functioning correctly
and to calibrate the WindSensor position.
The code reads this in using the pulseIn function then maps it to the 
desired range of -180 to 180 degrees. Both the pulse value and the 
mapped values are displayed to the serial Monitor.

First the PWM signal from the sensor is read in.  Nominal values for 
the position are 0 to 1023. Use the code to determine if the actual range 
is smaller and if there are "dead spots". You can then change the map function 
accordingly.  The input data and the corresponding angle are displayed to the serial monitor.

Calibrate the WindSensor by rotating the encoder body while keeping the windvane 
pointing forward.  Tighten the encoder body to the mount when the value reads 0.
You will need a set of pliers and probably several tries.
