/* RCReader rev 7/17/2015
Â© 2014-2015 RoboSail
This program puts the Arduino micro-computer in the RC (Radio Control)system 
It takes in the control signals coming in from the Receiver and 
displays the following to the Serial Monitor:
  - The actual "pulse" coming in from the receiver for each channel
    (typical range of 1000 - 2000)
  - the angle at which the rudder or sail should be positioned 
    given that command (in the RoboSail frame of reference) 

This program helps the user determine 
  - if they are reading good signals from the receiver (range of 1000 - 2000)
  - if the servos are functioning correctly and moving to the expected positions
  - if the Arduino computer is functioning correctly

Rudder and Sail data from the RC receiver are read in on 
digital pins 2 and 3 respectively.
