/* This code tests a servo connected to digital pin 8
On the robosail boats that is the Rudder servo
It typically runs from 40 (full CW) to 140 (full CCW), center 90
The user is aksed for a position to send the servo to 
and the program sens the servo there.
It is useful to find the servo limits and intermediate positions
Start with postions around 90 and move up/down from there
Record your values and use them in creating sailing algorithms
