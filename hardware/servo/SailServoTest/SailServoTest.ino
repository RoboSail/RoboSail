/* SailServoTest rev 6/28/2015
   Â© 2014-2015 RoboSail
   Test the various sail positions available by driving the
   sail servo to positons entered by the user.
   The user types in the desired angle through the Serial Monitor.
   0 means the sail is fully in, and 90 means the sail is 
   fully out (at 90 degrees).
   Note that the Sail Servo actual positions for full in and out are approx 55 and 125, 
   so the user's desired angles must be mapped in the code to these values.
