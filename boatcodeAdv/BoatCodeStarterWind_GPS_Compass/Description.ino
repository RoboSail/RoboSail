This program contains starter code for programming a boat 
using information from the Wind Sensor, GPS module and Compass/Accelerometer.
For detailed information about getting input from the WindSensor, GPS, Compass,
input from the RC receiver, and sending output to the Servos,
see these programs: WindSensor, GPSTest, CompassTest and RCPassThrough

Program values are displayed to the Serial Monitor when the 
variable "verbose" is set to true.  otherwise set verbose to false.

Wind data is displayed in degrees with irons wind = 0, 
and GPS data is calculated and displayed as relative (x,y)
position from start on powerup.
